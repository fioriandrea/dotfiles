# dotfiles

My Arch Linux Dotfiles.

# Description

These are the dotfiles that I use on my main machine.
Although some things are optimized for arch in particular (especially some aliases), all these files should work just fine on any GNU/Linux system (given that the right dependencies are installed).

# Scripts

Some scripts that are used in the various configs can be found in .local/scripts.

# Installation

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fioriandrea/dotfiles/master/.local/scripts/install-dotfiles | bash
```
